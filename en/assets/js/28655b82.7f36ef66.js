This ",(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Session ID")," can then be mapped to a data structure on the web server side. In that data structure, you can store all the information you need. This approach is much safer for storing information about users, rather than storing it in a ",(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"cookie"),'. This way, the information cannot be misused by suspicious clients or connections. In addition, this approach is more "appropriate" if there is a lot of data to be stored.
