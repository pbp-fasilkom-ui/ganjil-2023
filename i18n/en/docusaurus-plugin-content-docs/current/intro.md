# Hello World!

Welcome to the tutorial session for Platform-based Programming (shortened to PBP)
course! The purpose of tutorial session is to provide you guided exercises and
supplementary materials that hopefully will help you understand the learning
materials better.

If you need additional assistance in understanding the learning materials, feel
free to discuss with your classmates and the teaching team (i.e lecturers and
teaching assistants). We have a proverb in Indonesian, _"Malu bertanya, sesat di jalan"_,
that roughly translates to English as _"You will get lost if you are afraid to ask for directions"_.
We are a social creature, so it is inevitable to have some form of interaction
and communication with other human being. Do not afraid to speak out your mind!
