# &lt;img&gt; - Image

The image element is an element for displaying an image in a web page. It can
be defined by using a single `<img />` tag.

To display an image in the page, you need to provide a value to `src` attribute
in the tag. There are also other attributes you can define in the tag to
customise how the image is displayed. The attributes are explained in [Possible Attributes](#possible-attributes).

## Possible Attributes

-  `src`: The address (i.e. URL) pointing to the location where the image is
   stored.
-  `alt`: Textual description of the image that will be read by screen reader
   commonly used by visual-impaired people. It is also used as stand-in value
   that will be displayed by the browser if the image cannot be loaded.
-  `height`: Set the height of the image.
-  `width`: Set the width of the image.

> Note: As you progress in learning about Web design, you will notice that
> you can set the dimension of an image using HTML attribute and CSS.
> The recommended approach in defining the dimension, and the style of an
> image in general, is to use CSS. The main purpose of HTML is to define a
> **structure** to a web page, while CSS' is to tell browser how to display
> the elements in the page.

## Usage Example

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="example1" label="Display Images" default>
        <CodeEditor defaultValue={imgExample} />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
