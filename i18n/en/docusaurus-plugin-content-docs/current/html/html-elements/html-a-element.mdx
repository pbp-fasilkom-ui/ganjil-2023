# &lt;a&gt; - Anchor

The anchor element is an element to create a link to another website on the
Internet. It is also can be used to create a link to another element in the same
website. The element can be defined by using a pair of `<a>` and `</a>` tag.

To use anchor element, you need to specify the location of the targeted element,
which can be another website or an element in the same website), in a property
named `href` in the opening tag of an anchor element. The location is usually a
string representing a URL. For example:

```html
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
```

The example above will make `GitHub` text to become a link to GitHub website,
which located at `https://github.com`.

The following is the list of possible attributes in an anchor tag:

-  `href`: Contains the address, usually written as URI/URL value, to the
   targeted element

   -  `_blank`: Opens the link in a new window
   -  `_parent`: Opens the link at the parent's page (only applicable when the
      anchor tag is defined as the value of a `<iframe>` tag)
