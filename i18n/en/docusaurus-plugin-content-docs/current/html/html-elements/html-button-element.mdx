# &lt;button&gt; - Button

The button element is an element that can be used to display a clickable button
in a web page. It can be defined by using a pair of `<button>` and `</button>`
tag.

You can use button to:

-  Create a link that displayed as a button. You need to put the button tag as
   the text value of an `<a>` tag.
-  Create a trigger for submitting data contained in one or more elements
   within a `<form>` tag.
-  Create a trigger for invoking JavaScript code that defined as value of
   `<script>` tag.

## Possible Attributes

-  `id`: Unique identifier of the element in the HTML page. It is usually used
   as unique reference to the element in a JavaScript code.
-  `name`: Name of the button. It is used to give text label to the associated
   value when the tag is defined in a `<form>` tag.
-  `value`: A value represented by the button when the tag is defined in a
   `<form>` tag. It is usually contain the data that may be submitted to the
   backend.
-  `disabled`: A boolean flag that determines whether the button is disabled,

   button is clicked.
