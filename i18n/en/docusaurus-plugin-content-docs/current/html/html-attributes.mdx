# HTML Attributes

By default, an HTML element has a default behaviour that will be determine how
the tag should be processed by the Web browser. The behaviour can be customised
by embedding additional information called **HTML attributes** into the element.

## Structure of an HTML Tag with Attributes

An HTML element may have more than one attributes. Each attribute can be
separated using **spaces** or **new lines**. The following subsections will
explain the difference and provide an example.

### Example 1: Using Spaces

We can create an anchor tag (`<a>`) to define a link to another location in a
Web page or a Web site. The following code snippet is an example of an `<a>`
tag:

```html
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">A cool video on YouTube</a>
```

The `<a>` tag above encloses a text value (i.e `A cool video on YouTube`) and
has two attributes separated with empty spaces. The explanation for each
attribute is as follows:

-  `href` attribute that is used to point to a location. In the example above,
   `href` contains a URL to a video on YouTube.
-  `target` attribute determines how the link will be opened by the Web browser.
   `_blank` value will make the Web browser to open the link in a new window.

### Example 2: Using New Lines

If you are going to define quite amount of attributes in an HTML element or
some of the attributes will have lengthy values, then you can separate the
attributes using new lines (`\n`) as depicted in the following code snippet:

```html
<a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  target="_blank"
  style="color: red;"
>
  A cool video on YouTube
</a>
```

The `<a>` tag above has three attributes: `href`, `target`, and `style`. The
`href` and `target` attributes behave as described in previous subsection. The
`style` attribute defines how the element will be styled and displayed by the
Web browser using in-line cascading style sheet (CSS).
