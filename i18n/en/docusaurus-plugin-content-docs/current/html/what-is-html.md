# What is HTML?

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a **markup language** that is used for defining
the layout of a Web page. You use HTML to provide structure to your content so
they are organised in a way that can be understood by a Web browser. If written
correctly, HTML document can be parsed by a Web browser alongside with other
files such as Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and client-side scripts (e.g JavaScript
files) and display the content to the user.

As a **language**, HTML does have rules in form of syntax and grammar. You can
learn about those rules by reading the related document about HTML structure and
elements in this site. For example, most of HTML tags are written in pair, i.e
a tag may have an opening and closing element. Consequently, some browsers might
not display the content correctly if they find a HTML tag that is not properly
closed.

It is important to know that HTML is **not a programming language.** It is only
used to define structure of a content in a Web page. HTML does not have the
capability to represent a control flow that commonly found in an actual
programming language such as Python and Java. You will learn more about this
in Language Theory & Automata course. But, if you are really curious, try to
look up the definition of a Turing-complete language and see whether HTML fits
the criteria of a Turing-complete language.
