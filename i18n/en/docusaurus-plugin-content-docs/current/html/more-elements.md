# More Elements

In this document, we only mentioned the subset of HTML elements that frequently
used when building a website. There are many more HTML elements out there that
we have not covered in the tutorial. If we are referring to the HTML5 standard,
there are at least **132** HTML elements, and not all of them might be applicable
in this course.

If you want to learn more about the elements available in the HTML5 standard,
you can read the following resources:

-  [W3Schools (recommended for beginners)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
-  [Mozilla Developer Network Web Docs (more in-depth)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
